## Overview
- Dana has asked for our help in building a website for fellow UFO spectators. This website should be dynamic and allow site users to filter through hundreds of UFO sightings in different locations, on many dates, and in a variety of shapes.
- The main tools used to create this site and it's filters are JavaScript and HTML.

## Results

- Interested parties can now filter the UFO sightings in many ways. We have added the function to filter by not only date, but also city, state, country, and/or shape.  
- These filters can be used one at a time or in combination with each other.
- The process is very simple, all you have to do is type search criteria into each of the filter options that you want to filter by and hit the "Enter" button on your keyboard. The page will refresh and filter the data in your search.
- This is exciting news for the UFO spectating world, examples are below!

- Filter by "Date" and "State" at the same time!

- You can even filter by shape!

## Summary
- Even though these features are awesome, everything can be improved right? Right. I would suggest replacing the open entry box for "shape" with a dropdown menu. This way site visitors wouldn't have to guess which shapes where available in the data.
